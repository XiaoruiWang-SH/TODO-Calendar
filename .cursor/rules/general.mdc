# Running environment
- It maybe running locally or remove server connected through ssh.
- Always use existing terminal window, because it probably has already entered into right environment(local or remote)
- If you can't find the correct existing terminal, try to use ssh to connect to remote environment, using this command "ssh -i /Users/raywang/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@164.92.198.234" to connect.


# Git Commitment
- Always generate simple sentence
- Just say what I did, don't say for something or purpose
- only one sentence, if content of commitment is a lot, onlysummarize main feature modification.
